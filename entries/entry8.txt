Lily

Date: Still going

They say the deepest pain changes you.
I never understood what that meant until she left.

In 2023, my world cracked open.
After four years of love, laughter, and what I thought was unbreakable trust… my ex chose someone she barely knew over everything we shared. Just like that, I was no longer "home" to someone I gave my heart to.

I won’t lie I was shattered.
There were nights I lay still in bed, staring at the ceiling, wondering how everything unraveled so fast.
Christmas wasn’t the same. New Year’s felt empty.
I wasn’t even crying most of the time I was just… hollow.
That kind of pain doesn’t scream it whispers in the quiet, and it lingers long after the tears are gone.

But somewhere in the middle of that heartbreak, a voice inside whispered something else:
“Self-improvement.”

If I couldn’t change what happened, then maybe… just maybe… I could change me.
So I did.

I started choosing myself even when it hurt.
Even when the days felt meaningless. Even when the nights dragged me back into memories I didn’t want to remember.
I told myself, “This isn’t the end of me. This is the beginning.”

2024 was the year I rebuilt not loudly, but faithfully.
No applause. No spotlight. Just quiet, stubborn growth.

And then… she came.

No grand entrance. No signs from the sky. Just a conversation.
Just a moment.

But in that moment it felt like the air shifted.
Like something magical had quietly walked in and sat next to me without saying a word.
She didn’t save me I had already begun saving myself.
But she reminded me what color looked like again.

I had a crush on her around September 2024, but I buried it deep. I was still healing. I was scared.
I told myself, “Don’t fall again. Not yet.”
But no matter how I tried to ignore it, something about her felt different.

And then one day, it just… happened.
A spark in a normal conversation, and suddenly, the world didn’t feel gray anymore.
It wasn’t loud or dramatic. It was gentle.
Like light pouring slowly through a cracked window after years of darkness.

For the first time in a long time I smiled for no reason.
I’d catch myself grinning in the middle of the day just thinking about her.
No more plain days.
Just warmth.

I didn’t even realize it at first, but I had started praying for her.
Not for us to be together just for her.
Her health. Her safety. Her peace. Her dreams. Her family.
And quietly, at the end:

> “If she’s the one, God… please show me. Through time.”

God didn’t say “yes.”
He didn’t say “no.”
He said wait.

So that’s what I’m doing waiting, but not standing still.

I’m growing. Building. Healing.
I’m becoming the man I know I can be not for anyone else, but for me.
And if she is meant to be part of that story then when the time is right, I’ll be ready.

I call her Lily my favorite flower.
Not because she knows it, but because that name holds meaning to me.
A lily grows in quiet places. It stands tall in silence. It’s beautiful without trying.

Just like her.

I’ve even found a song that feels like her:
"Lily of the Valley" by Daniel.
It’s soft. Honest. Pure.

Will I pursue her?
Yes. But not now.
When God gives the green light not my timing, His.

Until then, I’ll stay close cheering her on, praying for her, valuing every little moment we share.
Not chasing. Not rushing.
Just admiring, appreciating, becoming.

See you soon, Lily.
If you're the one, I’ll wait not just patiently, but purposefully.
And if you’re not… then thank you.
Thank you for showing me that my heart can still feel deeply.
That joy can return.
That after all the loss love still lives in me.🌸
