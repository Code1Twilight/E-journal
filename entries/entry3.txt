A Leader, not a Boss

May: 26,2025

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the kind of leader I’ve become—and how much I’ve grown throughout our thesis journey. It started back in the 2nd semester of 2nd year, and now, as we approach the final stretch in the 1st semester of 4th year, I can’t help but feel thankful for everything we’ve been through as a team.

Looking back, I realized something I hadn’t fully acknowledged before:
I was an efficient and strong leader to my group.

In a time when other groups were struggling—facing conflict, miscommunication, resentment, and even fights—I felt so blessed that our group was different. We had no drama, no silence, no unheard voices. We talked openly. We made sure no one felt left out. We solved problems together. And for that, I give all the glory to God, because He guided me to lead with wisdom, humility, and patience.

Through this experience, I understood something important:

> Being a leader isn’t about holding a position—it’s about carrying a mindset.



Many of my classmates confused being a leader with being a boss. But they’re not the same. A boss gives orders. A leader builds unity. I’ve seen it with my own eyes: some groups acted like their leader was a ruler, not a teammate. That mindset caused division. They worked as individuals, not as a team.

But in my group, I saw us differently. We acted as one.
We lifted each other up. We made space for every idea. We faced every problem together. I never led with pride—I led with purpose.

I’m so grateful to God for blessing me with the mindset of a real leader, not someone chasing authority or control, but someone serving alongside others. And I pray I carry this kind of leadership wherever life takes me next.

Because true leadership isn’t about being above others—
It’s about walking with them.
