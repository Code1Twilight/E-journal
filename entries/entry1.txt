The kuya i was meant to be

January: 08,2025

Growing up as the bunso—the youngest child—I never had the chance to experience what it was like to be a kuya. I’ve always wondered what it would feel like to care for someone younger than me. I used to wish for a little sister or brother, but my parents were already old by the time I came along. I understood I would be the last, but still, a part of me always hoped.

Even as the youngest, I didn’t always feel like one. My mind felt older, more mature, even when I was just 19. I started thinking like someone with responsibility, someone who wanted to guide, protect, and give—not just receive. At 21 now, I realize I’ve carried that feeling with me ever since.

Then, something happened. I met someone—not related to me by blood—but I saw her like a younger sister. And from the moment I made that connection, I felt something shift. I treated her the way a real kuya would. I gave what I could. I made sure she felt protected. I looked out for her like I was her shield from the world. I found myself doing for her what my older brother used to do for us—and in those moments, it felt real. Like I had stepped into a role I was meant to play.

It made me genuinely happy. Not just because I finally had the chance to act like a kuya, but because I realized I wanted to take on that responsibility. I didn’t do it out of obligation. I did it out of love and instinct.

It wasn’t about being the eldest or youngest anymore. It wasn’t about blood.
It was about the feeling—the connection. The role I embraced naturally.

I may have been born the bunso, but deep inside, I’ve always had a kuya’s heart.

And now, through this experience, I got to live it.
