Appreciating Everything

June: 06,2025

Back when I was healing from losing someone I loved someone I thought would be by my side for a long time something shifted in me.
That pain, that emptiness… it brought a quiet lesson I still carry with me to this day:

> We should appreciate people before we no longer have the chance to.

It sounds like such a simple thing, right?
"Appreciate what you have."
We hear it all the time.
But the truth is… it’s not always easy to live by.

When people are constantly around us, we get used to them.
We start to think they’ll always be there.
Their presence becomes part of the background, like air—essential, but unnoticed.
And sometimes, by the time we realize how much they mattered… it’s too late.

But that heartbreak taught me something valuable.
Every moment with someone is an opportunity one that won’t last forever.

So I started seeing things differently.
I began to truly appreciate the people in my life not just in the big ways, but in the little ones too.
The way someone checks in.
The way someone listens.
The quiet support. The shared laughter. The small efforts.

Even the tiniest acts of love became something I held onto with deep gratitude.

Because now I know:
One day, those people might not be by my side anymore.
And I never want to look back and wish I’d loved them better.

I’m thankful I learned that lesson when I did.
Grateful that I took the time to appreciate those around me even if they’re no longer in my life now.
I can look back and say, "I saw your worth while you were here."
And that brings peace.

So here’s what I remind myself every day now:

> Presence is a gift. Time is fragile. People are not promised.
Don’t wait to be grateful.
Don’t wait to say thank you.
Don’t wait to love louder.

Appreciate now.
While they’re still here.
While you still can.
