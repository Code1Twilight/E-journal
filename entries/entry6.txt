Rule 32: Enjoy the Little Things

June: 06,2025

I was watching Zombieland the other day a movie I’ve seen before, but this time, something stuck.
The main character has all these survival rules, but one in particular stood out to me like never before:
Rule 32: Enjoy the little things.

At first, it sounds so simple.
Almost like a throwaway line.
But the more I thought about it, the more it hit me.
This is a rule for surviving more than just zombies—it’s a rule for surviving life.

Because honestly…
So often we get caught up in chasing big things.
Big dreams. Big goals. Big moments.
And in the process, we forget the small stuff the quiet blessings, the everyday beauty, the little joys.
We stop noticing how the coffee tastes in the morning.
Or how nice it feels when someone smiles at us.
Or how comforting it is to hear our favorite song on a random day.

We take those little things for granted, even though they’re the foundation of everything.

The truth is, without the little things, we wouldn’t even reach the big things.
We overlook them, and in doing so, we sometimes miss the very moments that make life feel full.

When I realized that something in me changed.
I started paying attention more.
Noticing more.
Appreciating more.

And I found that the more I noticed and enjoyed the little things, the more alive I felt.
Like when I see a child laugh.
Or when I feel the cool breeze at night.
Or even when someone sends me a message just to check in it means so much more now.

Those little moments are no longer small.
They’re everything.

So I guess what I’m learning what I want to keep learning is this:

> Joy doesn’t always come in loud, life-changing moments.
Sometimes, it’s in the soft, quiet things we used to pass by without a second thought.

And maybe the happiest people aren’t the ones who have everything…
Maybe they’re the ones who see something in everything.

So yeah thanks, Zombieland.
I may not be running from zombies, but I’m surviving my own kind of chaos.
And Rule 32?
That one’s staying with me for good.
