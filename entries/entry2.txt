A heart that wants to give

April: 09,2025

Today, I realized something deeply heartwarming: there’s greater joy in giving than in receiving.

I remember the times when I used to pray and ask God how I could be a blessing to others. I wasn’t sure what that would look like. I didn’t have money. I didn’t have anything big to offer. But slowly, God began answering in a different way—He taught me how to become the best version of myself. And when I did, I saw how I could bless others just by being me.

Having emotional intelligence and empathy helped me understand what people were feeling. I listened to them. I stood by them. And they began thanking me for things I thought were small—just being there, just understanding. That’s when I knew: this was one of the ways I could be a blessing.

But still, I prayed for more.
I told God I didn’t want to stop at listening or being emotionally present—I wanted to give financially, too. Even though I’ve always been tight on money, I believed that God would give me a good way to earn.

In October 2024, I tried to be a financial blessing to someone—but I wasn’t able to do it like I hoped. It felt awkward, unfamiliar. I wasn’t used to giving in that way. But then, 2025 came—and things began to change. Slowly, I started to treat people in small ways: lunch here, a snack there, even doing something kind for my own sister. They were small acts, but they gave me so much joy.

And I realized something I’ll carry for the rest of my life:

> The more I give, the more I feel full.
The more I bless others, the more I feel blessed.

I’m still praying. I still ask God to give me more so I can give more. Not for pride or attention, but so I can reflect His love through my actions. Giving is not just a duty for me now—it’s part of who I am.

All glory to God.
I don’t have everything, but I have a heart that wants to give. And that is enough—for now.
