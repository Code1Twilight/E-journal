The Day i felt like a Adult

June 2,2025

Today, I found myself thinking about something I didn’t expect to feel this deeply—not yet, at least. A while ago, when I was out grocery shopping with my sister, something shifted inside me. It was a simple moment: walking through the aisles, choosing what to buy. In that moment, in my mind, I imagined that I was paying with my own money—even though, in reality, it was my sister’s cash. Still, the feeling was so vivid that I felt like I was the one providing. Somehow, it meant more than just groceries.

It felt like I was providing.
Not just for myself, but for my family.
It was like I had stepped into a new role—one I used to associate with adults, with parents, with older siblings. And yet, here I am… 21 years old, a fourth-year college student, and the youngest in the family.

In Filipino culture, the bunso (the youngest) is often seen as carefree, protected, or even “spoiled” in a loving way. After graduation, they’re rarely expected to carry heavy responsibilities. Usually, it’s the eldest or the middle child who helps out with family expenses or supports the younger ones.

But here I am, the bunso… and I’m already thinking about how I can give back.
How I want to work, not just for myself, but so I can provide for my parents.
So I can bring home groceries. So I can stop asking for money and start giving instead.
And oddly enough… I’m not afraid of that thought. I’m happy about it.

I find joy in the idea of providing, of being someone my parents can rely on, even if no one is pressuring me to do so. It makes me feel proud. It makes me feel like I’m growing—not just in age, but in heart.

I don’t think this is weird anymore.
I think this is what love looks like when it turns into responsibility.
I think this is what maturity feels like when it comes from a place of gratitude.

I may be the last child, but I carry a heart that wants to give first.

And maybe… that’s more than enough.
